This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Tcl when dealing with list manipulation. The `append` command treats the list as a string, concatenating the new element to the end.  The `lappend` command correctly adds the element as a new list element.  The `bug.tcl` file shows the incorrect usage of `append`, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides the correct implementation using `lappend`.
